Yes, you can still implement these features and showcase them during the demo day! Submitting the form likely locks in your participation, but adding new features before the event demonstrates initiative, creativity, and responsiveness to user engagement.

Hereâ€™s how you can quickly integrate and present these features:

---

### **1. Prioritize Simplicity for Demo Day**
- **Minimum Viable Features**: Implement basic versions of the leaderboard and badges.
  - **Leaderboard**: 
    - Focus on displaying the top 5 quiz scores.
    - Hardcode a few dummy scores if necessary for the demo.
  - **Badges**:
    - Implement a static badge display for a user profile (e.g., one or two example badges).

---

### **2. Implementation Plan Before Demo Day**
#### **Leaderboard**
1. **Mock Data**: 
   - Use hardcoded quiz scores if integrating with Firebase isn't feasible before the demo:
     ```javascript
     const leaderboardData = [
       { username: "Alice", score: 95 },
       { username: "Bob", score: 88 },
       { username: "Charlie", score: 85 },
     ];
     ```
   - Render this in a simple table.

2. **Interactive Touch**:
   - Allow a quiz submission during the demo to update the leaderboard (even locally).

#### **Badges**
1. **Static Display**:
   - Design 3-5 badges as PNG or SVG images.
   - Add them to a user profile section for visual impact.

2. **Demo Interaction**:
   - Simulate badge earning when an action is completed (e.g., "Explore a career").
   - Use a popup or animation to display "Congratulations, you earned the Career Explorer badge!"

### **3. Presentation Tips**
- **Storytelling**:
  - Introduce these features as a response to student feedback or engagement ideas.
  - Mention how the leaderboard fosters friendly competition and badges encourage exploration.

- **Interactive Demo**:
  - Showcase how users can:
    - Participate in a quiz and see their name appear on the leaderboard.
    - Earn badges through specific actions.

- **Highlight Benefits**:
  - Explain how these gamified elements make career exploration fun and engaging.

### **4. Post-Demo Integration**
After demo day, you can fully integrate these features with Firebase or your backend. For now, focus on making the demo impactful, even if the features are partly simulated. This will leave a strong impression on the audience and judges!
